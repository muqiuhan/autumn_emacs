AutumnEmacs is a minimalist GNU Emacs configuration, which will pre-configure OCaml, Racket, Clojure, CommonLisp, Scheme, and EmacsLisp development environments for you, including some related productivity plugins.

note that:
- this project uses the vterm pluigin, so cmake must be installed
- this project uses the all-the-icons font, so you must install this font, I provide these font files in the site-lisp directory.

wish you a happy life.
